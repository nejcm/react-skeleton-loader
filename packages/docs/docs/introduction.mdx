# Introduction

[React Skeleton Loader](https://github.com/nejcm/react-skeleton-loader) is a
library for displaying skeleton loaders that allows customization with some
predefined templates.

## Motivation

Users ofter have to wait for content to load. Designing loading states is often
overlooked or dismissed as an afterthought.

Skeleton loaders provide a better user experience and perceived performance. The
idea is that users are more patient and will think of a system as faster if they
know what's going on and can anticipate content before it's actually there.
